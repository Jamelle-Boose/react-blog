# Build a website with React, React-Bootstrap, React-Router and Styled-Components

Create a website with React Bootstrap, Styled Components and React Router. React-Bootstrap is used to quickly style our page with their selection of prebuilt react components. Then we use styled-components to tweak some of the styles. Finally, we use react-router page navigation in our navbar.

## Installation

Use the package manager [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install dependencies.

```bash
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap react-router-dom styled-components
```
